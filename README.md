# Docker: Perforce Server for Unreal Engine

This is the Xist.GG Docker config to set up a Perforce Server
for development in Unreal Engine.

This will intialize P4D with Xist's
[Perforce Setup](https://github.com/XistGG/Perforce-Setup)
`typemap` for Unreal Engine projects.

Based on Ubuntu `jammy` which should be relatively stable.

Thanks to [froyok]()
for the excellent blog covering the topic of
[How to Install P4D into a Docker Container]((https://www.froyok.fr/blog/2018-09-setting-up-perforce-with-docker-for-unreal-engine-4/)).

Thanks to [ambakshi](https://github.com/ambakshi/)
for providing the [base repo](https://github.com/ambakshi/docker-perforce/tree/master/perforce-server)
that inspired (and provided initial code for) this one.
